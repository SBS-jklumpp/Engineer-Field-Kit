# Usage

This document is a practical “how to” for day-to-day workflows.

## Typical workflow
1. Connect instrument / debug adapter
2. Open the serial console
3. Start logging (optional)
4. Visualize key signals / stats
5. Save plots or export data for reports

## Tips
- If you are chasing noise: isolate the physical setup first (grounding, cable routing, power source).
- Capture enough time to see drift and patterns.
- Save raw logs before applying filters.

## Export
If the app supports export, prefer:
- CSV for numeric series
- PNG for quick screenshots
- JSON for structured configuration snapshots
